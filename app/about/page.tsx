        <h1>About Dera Muslim Youth Jemea</h1>
        <p>
          Founded in Dera, Oromia, Dera Muslim Youth Jemea (DMYJ) was established to strengthen the moral, educational, and social foundation of our youth. What began as a small group of dedicated volunteers has grown into a community-wide movement for empowerment, education, and service.
